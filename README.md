# 💌 Proposal Web App

This project is a fun proposal web application designed to make your confession or special question memorable! 🥰 It takes the user through a series of playful, animated pages, making the experience interactive and joyful. Each page has unique stickers and fun dialogues with Yes/No buttons for engagement.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Multi-Page Flow:**
  - **Page 1:** "Do you love me?" with a cute bear sticker 🐻.
  - **Page 2:** "Please think again! Itni jaldi nahi matt bolo" 🥺.
  - **Page 3:** "Ek aur baar soch lo! Kyu aisa kar rahi ho?" 😢.
  - **Page 4:** "Baby maan jao! Kinna bhavv khaogi?" with playful behavior 💕.

- **Playful No Button:** On the final page, the "No" button keeps dodging to add some humor, leaving only the "Yes" button clickable. 😉

- **End Surprise:** If "Yes" is clicked, the app congratulates the user with a heartwarming message:
  - "Yay! 🥳 I knew you'd say YES! I promise to make every day special with you. ❤️"
